## Why write an R package?

- Avoid having the same function in multiple places
- Easy to keep track of and reuse functions
- Document your functions
- Share and collaborate

## What you need

- RStudio
- `roxygen2` package installed

# Package Components

## `R/` folder (*required*)

This is where all the R code goes.

## DESCRIPTION (*required*)

![](./screenshots/description.png)\


Other optional options:

- **Imports**: packages your package needs
- **URL**: link to source code
- **BugReports**: link to where bugs can be reported

## `man/` folder (*required*)

Reference documents for each function (or group of functions) accessed by `?` or `help()`.

## Optional Components

- **vignettes/**: Long and detailed documentation
- **NAMESPACE**: (*advanced if edited manually*) Automatically generated when using `roxygen2`
- **data/**: Where you can include `.rda` files available to all users
- **src/**: (*advanced*) Where you can include compiled code (e.g. C or C++)
- **inst/**: Additional files (e.g. text files, images, or raw data); can have subdirectories
- etc.
